_Now, I know that NOT ALL fans of controversial fandoms like Forsaken or Dandy's World are horrible people, but most of them are based off my experience. But hey, if you're really sure that you're not a toxic person, feel free to int! But these people on the list must stay 10 solar systems away from me._

> Spawnists : How are yall jumping off bridges for a game ICON??

> Homophobes : I'm saying this as a straight person, but did the gays kill your grandma?

> Italian Brainrot : Please. NO. NONONO.

> AI "Artists: : Self explanatory lmao

_And generally toxic people should stay away too._
