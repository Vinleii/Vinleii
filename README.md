`LOADING : User's DNI List...`

_Now, I know that NOT ALL fans of controversial fandoms like Forsaken or Dandy's World are horrible people, but most of them are based off my experience. But hey, if you're really sure that you're not a toxic person, feel free to int! But these people on the list must stay 10 solar systems away from me._

> Spawnists : How are yall jumping off bridges for a game ICON??

> Homophobes : Did the gays kill your grandma?

> Italian Brainrot : Please. NO. NONONO.

> AI "Artists: : Self explanatory

> Chronically Online people : Guys!!! I'm typing '.' everytime someone breathes!!! Wait... why isn't anyone laughing?


_And generally toxic people should stay away too_
